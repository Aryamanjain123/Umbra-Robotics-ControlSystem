# Umbra Robotics Control Library — Advanced VEX Robotics Library

`Umbra` is a competition-ready robotics library for VEX robots, designed to make autonomous and driver-control code **clean, powerful, and simple**.  

Features include:
- PID++ (settling, anti-windup, slew, filters, telemetry)
- Feedforward (kS, kV, kA) with auto-fitting
- Motion profiles (trapezoid + S-curve)
- Trajectory follower with events
- Odometry++ (3-wheel + IMU fusion + GPS correction)
- Pose math (SE(2), mirroring, transforms)
- Telemetry (ring buffer, CSV logging to SD)
- Hardware support (pneumatics, vision pipelines)
- Significantly more
